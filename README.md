# TikTok-Auto-Scroller
This is a chrome extension written in JavaScript that is a TikTok auto scroller. 

NOTE: This repo is no longer relevant as the UI on TikTok has been updated, and additionally, they have finally implemented an auto-scroll feature on their end. I will keep this repo up if for some reason they remove auto-scrolling and the UI is changed back. 

If you want to test this yourself:
1. Download this repo and un-zip it.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Turn on Developer Mode (should be at the top right)
4. Click on "Load Unpacked" and select the un-zipped folder.
5. Go to TikTok.com and click on the first video you see.
